/**
 * socket-probe — single source of truth for control-socket liveness.
 *
 * Why this is a shared lib (not a per-file copy): every surface that asks
 * "is this control socket live?" must answer identically. The entwurf-control
 * extension (`pi-extensions/entwurf-control.ts`, GC) and the v2 dispatch/listing
 * path (`socket-discovery.ts` → `entwurf-fact-provider.ts`, and the production
 * decider deps) used to carry independent `isSocketAlive` copies. If only one
 * side learned the three-valued classification the two probes would diverge —
 * dispatch routes a timeout target one way while GC reclaims the same socket.
 * All of them consume this module instead. (The bridge no longer probes at all:
 * its socket-scan lane went with #50 C4, so it reaches liveness only through
 * the fact provider.)
 *
 * Three-valued, not boolean — the F3 fix. A connect probe can mean three
 * different things, and collapsing them to a boolean is what let
 * `gcStaleSockets` permanently unlink a *live* socket that merely stalled
 * under load (→ every later probe sees it as dormant → live-session resume =
 * identity split). The cure: never destroy a socket we do not understand.
 *   - alive          → a listener accepted the connection (positive proof)
 *   - dead           → ECONNREFUSED / ENOENT only (positive proof of absence)
 *   - indeterminate  → timeout, EACCES, or any other/unknown error
 *                      (no proof either way — keep the file, never destroy it)
 *
 * This module owns ONE policy, `shouldUnlinkOnGc` (GC reclaims dead only). The
 * old listing policy (`shouldListAsLive`) left with its last consumer in #50 C4:
 * `indeterminate` is now carried all the way to the surface as a fact, not
 * hidden — `entwurf_peers` shows it and the v2 decider rejects on it by name.
