/**
 * entwurf-v2-runner — the pure EXECUTE-router (5d-1, `executeDispatch`) AND the top-level
 * decide→execute join (5d-2a, `runEntwurfV2`) for the unified `entwurf_v2` verb, both in
 * this one file because they share the `EntwurfV2RunResult` vocabulary and neither does IO.
 * `executeDispatch` takes a `DispatchDecision` the 5b decider ALREADY produced and routes it
 * to the right 5c transport hand, returning ONE outcome-rich `EntwurfV2RunResult`. It performs
 * ZERO IO of its own and makes ZERO routing decisions — `decideDispatch` chose the plan,
 * this only DISPATCHES it. Each hand is an injected dep (the gate fakes them; 5d-2 wires
 * the production `executeControlSocketSend` / `executeSpawnBgResume` / production
 * `sendViaMailbox`), so the routing + result mapping is gate-provable without a socket,
 * spawn, or timer — the same pure-before-IO, IO-via-dep discipline 5b/5c kept.
 *
 * Why a result type richer than the receipt: the carry-over contracts from 5c demand it.
 *   - N3 (5c-2b): a dead-path re-resolve `rejected` carries the resolver's `rejectReason`
 *     (dormant-fire-forget-unsupported / mailbox-undeliverable / …). The runner carries it
 *     verbatim so the surface distinguishes "in-band refusal" from "no live route".
 *   - N1 (5c-2a): a non-`failed` outcome whose `releaseLock` then threw is a
 *     `SendDeliveredReleaseFailedError` — the delivery HAPPENED, the lock is dirty, a
 *     re-send would double-deliver. The runner surfaces this as `execution-failed` with
 *     `finalizedOutcome` + `releaseFailed` so the surface renders "delivered, lock dirty,
 *     do NOT retry", never "send failed".
 *   - spawn-bg `lock-retained` is a RETURNED result (fail-closed, not a throw): it rides
 *     the `executed` branch so 5d's surface can render the retained-lock diagnostic.
 *
 * `retrySafe` is conservatively `false` on EVERY `execution-failed`: a thrown send is
 * never confidently retry-safe (an `indeterminate` connect may have delivered to an
 * alive-but-stalled socket — the exact double-delivery hazard 5c-2a refuses to gamble on).
 * The runner never re-judges the lock — it passes `decision.lock` to the hand verbatim and
 * lets the hand's `decideReleasePolicy` fail loud on a mis-pairing.
